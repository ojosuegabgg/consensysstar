# 👋 Hi, I’m consensysstar

I’m a **Senior Fullstack Engineer** with a love for building **real-time, interactive web apps and multiplayer games**.
Over the past few years I’ve worked across startups and ambitious projects, turning complex ideas into fast, scalable products.
I lean **frontend** but enjoy owning the **full stack**—from elegant UIs to resilient backend systems.

### 🕹️ What I Do

* Craft **beautiful, responsive interfaces** with **React**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript**
* Build **real-time experiences** using **WebSockets**, event-driven backends, and distributed systems
* Bring apps to life with **animations** (Framer Motion, GSAP, Rive) that feel smooth and natural
* Work with **Node.js**, **Kafka**, and **Mongo/Postgres** to power data-heavy, high-traffic services
* Experiment with **blockchain tech** (Solana, Ethereum) to create on-chain games and dApps

### 🌱 A Little About Me

I enjoy working on products where **speed meets creativity**—games, interactive platforms, anything that challenges what the web can do.
I thrive in small, collaborative teams, where design and engineering come together to ship great things.
Outside of code, you’ll probably find me **testing new games**, contributing to open-source, or chasing down a perfect flat white. ☕

### ⚡ Fun Fact

I once stayed up all night debugging a multiplayer game only to realize… it was a single missing **semicolon**.
(Still worth it. Players logged in the next morning without a hitch.)
